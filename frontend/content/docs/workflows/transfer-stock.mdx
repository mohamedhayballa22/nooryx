An Internal Transfer is the process of moving inventory from one physical or logical location to another within your organization. Unlike a **Shipment**, which removes stock from your assets to fulfill an order, a transfer keeps the inventory on your books but changes its location.

Nooryx handles transfers as "atomic" events. This means the movement happens instantaneously in the system data: stock is decremented from the source and incremented at the destination in a single action. However, two distinct ledger entries are created to maintain a clear audit trail.

## The Transfer Flow

1.  Navigate to the **Inventory** page or a specific **Master SKU** page.
2.  Select **Transfer Stock** from the action menu.
3.  A form will appear to capture the movement details.

### Atomic Movement

In Nooryx, standard transfers do not use an "In Transit" holding state. When you submit a transfer, the inventory quantity is immediately removed from the **Source Location** and added to the **Target Location**.

This approach ensures that your total inventory count remains constant throughout the operation, preventing "ghost inventory" where items temporarily disappear from the system while being moved.

### Cost Preservation

A critical distinction between transferring and adjusting stock is the handling of value.

*   **Adjustments** create a gain or loss on your financial reports.
*   **Transfers** preserve value.

When you transfer an item, Nooryx moves the item's cost history along with it. If a unit was received at $10.00 in "Warehouse A," it will arrive at "Warehouse B" valued at $10.00. This ensures your total inventory valuation remains accurate regardless of how often items are moved.

## Input Fields

In addition to SKU code which is searchable, the other fields are as follows:

| Field | Requirement | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Quantity** | Required | The number of units to transfer. Must be a positive number. |
| **Source Location** | Required | Where the inventory is currently physically located. |
| **Target Location** | Required | The destination where the inventory is being sent. |
| **Notes** | Optional | Any remarks regarding the transfer. |

## Submitting the Transfer

Once you confirm the transfer:

1.  **Validation:** Nooryx verifies that the **Source Location** has sufficient **Available** quantity to fulfill the transfer.
2.  **State Update:** The **On Hand** and **Available** counts are decreased at the source and increased at the target instantly.
3.  **Ledger Entry:** The system records the movement. While this appears as a single action to the user, the ledger maintains a strict history of the deduction from the source and the addition to the target to ensure full auditability.

You can view the history of these movements in the **Audit Trail**, filtering by the "Transfer" action type.
