Workflows manage the physical movement of goods. This section covers how Nooryx transforms those
movements into business intelligence. You use these features to assess the health of your inventory,
track financial value, and investigate past actions.

## Real-time Visibility

Nooryx provides two primary views for understanding your current inventory state.

The <Link href="/docs/management/dashboard">Dashboard</Link> serves as the entry point. It provides
a high-level summary of critical metrics. This view highlights immediate issues like stockouts and
identifies fast-moving items.

The <Link href="/docs/management/stock-list">Inventory</Link> page displays the list of all SKUs.
You use this interface to search for products, filter by location, and inspect the specific
"Available" versus "Reserved" status of your stock.

## Historical Traceability

Data in Nooryx is never overwritten. The <Link href="/docs/management/audit-trail">Audit Trail</Link>
exposes the history. It provides a chronological timeline of every event. You can trace exactly who
moved an item, when it happened, and the financial cost associated with the action.

## Financial Analysis

Tracking the monetary value of inventory is essential for accounting and profitability analysis.
The <Link href="/docs/management/valuation">Valuation</Link> page calculates your total asset
value and Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) in real-time. These figures are derived dynamically based
on your workspace's valuation method.

## Automated Alerting

Operators cannot monitor the dashboard constantly. <Link href="/docs/management/alerts">Alerts</Link>
track stock levels against your configuration. The system notifies you when items dip below low-stock
thresholds or reach reorder points. This helps you prevent overselling and maintain fulfillment
continuity without manual oversight.
