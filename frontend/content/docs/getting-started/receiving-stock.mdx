In Nooryx, you do not need to create a "Product" before you receive it. We combine creation and receipt into a single, fluid workflow. This allows you to move stock from the dock to the shelf without administrative friction.

## The Receiving Flow

1.  Navigate to the **Inventory** page in the sidebar.
2.  Click the **Receive Stock** button in the top-right corner.
3.  A form will slide out. This is where you define the **State** of the new inventory.

### Input Fields & Validation

Nooryx enforces strict data quality at the point of entry. We reject ambiguous data to prevent "ghost inventory" later.

| Field | Requirement | Why is this strict? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **SKU Code** | `A-Z`, `0-9`, `-` only. | Spaces and special characters break barcode scanners and integration APIs. |
| **SKU Name** | Max 80 chars. | Keeps reports and pick-lists readable. |
| **Location** | Required. | Inventory cannot exist in a void. It must have a physical coordinate. |
| **Quantity** | Min `1`. | You cannot receive zero or negative stock. |
| **Cost Price** | Min `0.01`. | Inventory is an asset; it must have a value for the Ledger. |
| **Notes** | Optional. | Use this field to record any relevant information. |

  SKU Codes are unique identifiers. Once created, the **SKU Code cannot be edited**, only archived. Ensure your naming convention is consistent (e.g., `CHR-GRY-FAB`). See the <Link href="/docs/core-concepts/skus">**SKU Guide**</Link> for details.
</Callout>

### Configuring Alerts

At the bottom of the form, you can toggle **Alerts**. This defines when Nooryx should bother you about this item in the future.

* **Reorder Point:** The quantity at which you need to buy more.
* **Low Stock Threshold:** The quantity at which you consider stock to be "low". It'll be displayed with an orange badge in the UI.

*Note: Both values must be whole numbers (integers).* See the <Link href="/docs/monitoring/alerts">**Alerting System Guide**</Link> for details.

Once you click **Receive**:

1.  **Validation:** Nooryx checks all rules (e.g., ensures Cost Price is not 0).
2.  **State Update:** The current inventory state is updated to reflect the new stock.
3.  **Ledger Entry:** A `Receive` transaction is written to the immutable ledger.
4.  **Feedback:** You will see a **Success Toast** notification.
5.  **Visual Confirmation:** A new row immediately appears in your Inventory.

All of this happens in under half a second.

You can click on the new row in the inventory to open the **Master SKU Page**. Here you can view the full history, the current state or adjust settings.
