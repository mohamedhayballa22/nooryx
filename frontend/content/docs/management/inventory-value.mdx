The Valuation page translates physical inventory data into financial metrics.
It provides a real-time view of the capital tied up in stock and the costs associated with recent sales.
This page serves as the primary data source for accounting reconciliation and profitability analysis.

## Financial Overview

The top panel displays two financial indicators. These metrics update in real-time as inventory moves in and out of the system.

### Total Inventory Value
This figure represents the current asset value of all "On Hand" stock. It is the sum of the cost of every unit physically present in your locations.

<Callout type="info">
  This value is calculated using the cost recorded at the time of receipt and your organization's <Link href="/docs/core-concepts/valuation#the-valuation-methods-nooryx-supports">**Valuation Method**</Link>.
</Callout>

### Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)
COGS represents the value of inventory that has left the system over a specific period.

While **Inventory Value** measures assets on the balance sheet, **COGS** measures expenses on the income statement. You can adjust the timeframe for this calculation (e.g., "Last Month" or "Last Quarter") using the dropdown menu.

<Callout type="warning">
Only shipments contribute to COGS in Nooryx.  
Negative inventory adjustments remove stock and cost from inventory but do not generate COGS.
</Callout>

## COGS Trend

The trend chart visualizes the distribution of costs over time. This helps operators correlate expenses with operational activity.

*   **Spikes** indicate periods of high fulfillment volume.
*   **Flatlines** indicate periods of low outbound activity.

Monitoring this trend allows you to verify that costs are being recognized in the correct periods, which is essential for accurate monthly closing.

## SKU Valuation Breakdown

The bottom table provides a granular financial breakdown for every product in the system.

*   **Total Quantity:** The physical count currently on hand.
*   **Average Cost:** The derived cost per unit. This is calculated by dividing the *Total Value* by the *Total Quantity*. This helps normalize cost fluctuations across different receiving batches.
*   **Total Value:** The aggregate value of that specific SKU.

You can use this table to identify which items are consuming the most working capital. High-value items with low turnover (high "Total Value" but low movement) often represent inefficient capital allocation.
