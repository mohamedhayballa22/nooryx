Inventory is a team sport. Nooryx lets you invite teammates to collaborate on stock operations, maintain accuracy, and keep your ledger auditable end-to-end.

## How to Invite Members in Nooryx

In your workspace:

1. Navigate to **Settings → Team & Access**.  
2. Select **Invite New Member**.  
3. Enter your teammate’s email address.  
4. Confirm the action.

The user will receive an email with a secure link to join your organization.

If you’d like to try the flow right now, use the demo below:

## What the Demo Shows

The interactive demo above mirrors what you’ll see inside the app when your team list is empty:

- Entering an email prompts a simulated invite action.  
- You’ll see the same visual feedback states as inside Nooryx—successful invite, invalid email, or other common cases.  
- Since this is documentation-only, nothing is sent, stored, or logged.

## User Roles

**During the current release, all invited members are granted Admin privileges.**  
This means every user gets full access to read the ledger, write transactions, and modify organization settings.

Until granular roles are introduced, we recommend inviting only trusted core teammates.

Role-based permissions are **actively in development** and coming very soon. We're taking the time to build a system that’s secure, intuitive, and aligned with Nooryx’s standards.

## Notifications & Alerts

Whenever a new member joins—or when critical inventory events happen—you’ll see them in the **Alerts** section of the sidebar.

<Callout type="info" title="Configuring Inventory Alerts">
  Stock-level alerts are configured **per SKU** during receiving. They can be customized and updated at any time. See the <Link href="/docs/monitoring/alerts">**Alerting System Guide**</Link> for details.
