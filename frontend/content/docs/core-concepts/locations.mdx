Locations are the physical or logical places where you store inventory. They can be as broad as **"Main Warehouse"** or as specific as **"Aisle 2 — Shelf A3"**. Whatever makes sense for your operation.  

Without location tracking, you might know you have 100 units company-wide, but you won’t know that 95 of them are in the wrong warehouse while customers wait.

Each location maintains its own stock levels for every SKU. The *same* product can have different quantities at different locations. Nooryx always knows exactly how much of each product you have at each location.

## Setting Up Locations

Locations are created automatically the first time you use them. When receiving or transferring stock, simply type the location name. **Nooryx treats every location name as unique**.

As you type, Nooryx automatically suggests existing locations so you don’t accidentally create duplicates. If the name already exists, Nooryx automatically reuses it.
A brand-new location can only be created when stock is **coming in**, during receiving or the inbound leg of a transfer.
Outbound actions like shipping cannot create new locations.

<Callout title="Flat, not hierarchical">
  Locations in Nooryx are not hierarchical.  
  If you want structure, design it directly in the name (e.g., “Aisle 2 — Shelf A3”).  
  Nooryx treats each name as a single, flat location identifier.

### Best Practices

- **Use clear, consistent names** your whole team will recognize. Avoid cryptic abbreviations that might confuse new employees.
- **Start simple** with 1–3 locations and add more as you scale. Don’t create unnecessary complexity early on.
- **Name with fulfillment in mind.** “Ecommerce FC” vs. “Retail Store” makes it immediately clear which stock is meant for what.

<Callout title="Don’t overthink it">
  If you’re a single-location business, just use something like “Warehouse” or “Main Stock.”  
  You can always add more locations later.

## Viewing Inventory by Location

You can view inventory at the location level throughout Nooryx.
The dashboard gives you location-level totals, each SKU page shows its distribution across locations, and all reports and tables support filtering by location.

### How Locations Affect Alerts

Alerts are scoped by location by default, meaning each location is monitored independently. However, alerts can be configured to act globally when needed.
Refer to the <Link href="/docs/management/alerts">**Alerting Guide**</Link> for more information.

## Moving Stock Between Locations

Use the **Transfer** feature to move inventory from one location to another.  
Nooryx records this as two linked events:

1. Stock leaves Location A  
2. Stock arrives at Location B

Your inventory value automatically follows your chosen accounting method (FIFO, LIFO, or WAC). No manual calculations needed.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="Can I rename a location after I've started using it?">
    No. Location names are permanent to preserve historical data integrity.  
    If you need to change naming conventions, create a new location and transfer stock into it.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if I only have one location? Do I still need to track it?">
    Yes. Even with one location, Nooryx needs a location name to record where stock lives.
    You’ll still get the full experience without any added complexity, and you’ll be ready to expand if a second location is ever needed.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I delete a location?">
    Locations with stock cannot be deleted.  
    Once a location has no stock and you stop using it, it simply stops appearing in suggestions and filters.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I see all my locations?">
    Nooryx automatically surfaces all active locations in dropdowns, tabs, and filters.  
    There’s no separate “location management” page. Locations appear organically as you use them.
  </Accordion>
