Your Workspace is the container for your organization’s data, team members, and inventory. When you sign up, Nooryx guides you through configuring your organization’s identity and a few foundational operating rules.

This is a short, one-time setup that establishes how your workspace behaves going forward.

## What you configure during setup

When creating your workspace, you will be asked for three key pieces of information:

### **Organization Name**
A simple label used throughout the interface and reports. You can update this at any time.

### **Currency**
This determines how monetary values are displayed across valuation, cost records, and reporting.  
You’ll only choose this once — after your workspace begins transacting, the currency becomes fixed to preserve consistency in your financial history.

### **Valuation Method**
You can choose from **FIFO**, **LIFO**, or **WAC**. This defines how Nooryx calculates the value of your stock.  
The choice shapes how cost records are produced and how your inventory is valued. Like currency, this cannot be changed once your ledger has activity.

<Callout type="warning" title="These Choices Are Permanent">
  Currency and valuation method are locked in once your workspace starts transacting.  
  This protects the integrity of your ledger and ensures your financial history remains consistent.  
  For the full rationale, see <Link href="/docs/core-concepts/valuation">**Valuation**</Link>.
</Callout>


## Form Fields Overview

You’ll see a short form during onboarding with:

- **Organization name**
- **Currency selector**
- **Valuation method selector**

After completing these fields, your workspace is created instantly — no implementation delay required.

## About Organization & User Settings

In addition to the core identity fields above, Nooryx also supports a range of optional settings that govern how your workspace behaves:

- **Organization Settings:** defaults for alerts, low-stock thresholds, and reorder points.
- **User Settings:** local preferences such as interface locale, pagination size, and date format.

These aren’t configured during workspace creation, but it’s good to know they exist. You can adjust them later. See <Link href="/docs/settings">**Settings**</Link> for a more detailed guide.

## What’s next?

Once your workspace is created, you’re ready to bring your team in and start collaborating.
