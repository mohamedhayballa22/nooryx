Now that you understand Nooryx's ledger-first architecture, let's explore the practical entities you will interact with daily. Every inventory operation in Nooryx revolves around three core concepts: **what** you're tracking, **where** it lives, and **how much** you have.

## The Inventory Equation

Inventory doesn't exist in the abstract—it is always a specific product sitting in a specific place. The combination of these two dimensions creates a **State**: your current stock levels at that exact intersection.

<EntityEquation />

Understanding this relationship is essential. You never just "add stock"; you add (or create) a specific **SKU** to a specific **Location**. These two dimensions—and the state they create—are embodied in a small set of core entities, which we detail in this section.

    The atomic unit of inventory. Defined by a unique code and name.

  <Card icon={<MapPin className="text-purple-500" />} title="Locations" href="/docs/core-concepts/locations">
    Physical or logical places. Stock is always location-specific.

  <Card icon={<StockLevelsIcon className="text-emerald-500" />} title="Stock State" href="/docs/core-concepts/stock-state">
    The real-time quantities derived from the ledger. Drives "In Stock" indicators.
