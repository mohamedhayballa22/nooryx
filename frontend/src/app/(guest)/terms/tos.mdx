# Terms of Service

**Last Updated:** January 12, 2026

These Terms of Service ("Terms") constitute a binding legal agreement between you (either an individual or an entity, "Customer", "You") and the providers of the Nooryx platform ("Nooryx", "Provider", "We", "Us").

Nooryx is a specialized inventory operations system designed to function as financial infrastructure for physical goods. By accessing or using our website, API, or services (collectively, the "Service"), you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you are entering into this agreement on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind such entity to these Terms.

If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not use the Service.

## 1. Nature of the Service

Nooryx is an inventory operation platform that prioritizes data integrity, auditability, and speed.

### 1.1 Not a Financial or Tax Advisor
While Nooryx provides advanced calculation methods (including FIFO, LIFO, and Weighted Average Cost) and tracks asset value, **Nooryx is not an accounting firm, tax advisor, or financial planner.**

- **User Responsibility:** You are solely responsible for verifying the accuracy of all financial reports, Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) calculations, and inventory valuations generated by the Service before using them for tax filings, financial statements, or fundraising.
- **Input Accuracy:** The integrity of the outputs is dependent on the integrity of your inputs. Nooryx is not responsible for financial discrepancies resulting from incorrect data entry, missed scans, or improper configuration of valuation settings.

### 1.2 "As Is" Service
The Service is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. While we strive for the highest standards of engineering reliability, we do not warrant that the Service will be uninterrupted, error-free, or entirely free of bugs.

---

## 2. Account Terms & Identity

### 2.1 Eligibility
You must be a human to use the Service. Accounts registered by "bots" or automated methods are not permitted.

### 2.2 Security and Credentials
- **One Seat, One Human:** Your login credentials are for your personal use only. Sharing a single user login among multiple individuals is strictly prohibited. You may invite colleagues to your Organization via the Team Management panel, provided they have their own seats.
- **Security:** You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and password. Nooryx cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.

### 2.3 Account Authority
If you create an account on behalf of a business, that business is the "Customer." The individual who creates the initial account is the "Owner" and has the highest level of control, including the ability to cancel the Service or delete the Workspace.

## 3. Acceptable Use & Ledger Integrity

Nooryx is built on an **immutable ledger philosophy**. To ensure the system remains audit-ready for all users, strict usage rules apply.

### 3.1 Prohibited Actions
You agree not to:
- **Circumvent the Ledger:** Attempt to reverse-engineer, bypass, or manipulate the underlying database or API logic to alter historical records without generating a trace event.
- **API Abuse:** Overload the Service with excessive requests that degrade performance for other users.
- **Illegal Commerce:** Use the Service to manage inventory for illegal goods, contraband, or items prohibited by the laws of your jurisdiction.
- **Resale:** Reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell, or exploit any portion of the Service without express written permission from us.

### 3.2 Violation
We reserve the right to suspend or restrict access to the Service immediately if we reasonably determine that your use of the Service poses a material risk to the stability, security, or integrity of our infrastructure. Where practicable, we will notify you of the suspension and work in good faith to resolve the issue.

## 4. Payment, Refunds, and Plan Changes

### 4.1 Subscription Terms
The Service is billed in advance on a recurring monthly or annual basis. A valid credit card is required for payment.

### 4.2 No Refunds
There are **no refunds or credits** for partial months of service, upgrade/downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open account. In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made. This does not affect your right to dispute incorrect charges or billing errors.

### 4.3 Price Changes
We reserve the right to modify pricing with 30 days' notice. Such notice may be provided at any time by posting the changes to the Nooryx site or the Service itself.

### 4.4 Taxes
All fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities. You shall be responsible for payment of all such taxes, levies, or duties.

---

## 5. Data Rights & Ownership

### 5.1 Your Data
**You own your data.** We claim no intellectual property rights over the material you provide to the Service. Your inventory data, customer lists, and transaction history remain yours.

### 5.2 Data Portability
Upon cancellation or termination, you retain the right to export your data. We guarantee the ability to export your core inventory and ledger data in standard formats (CSV or JSON). We will retain your data for **30 days** post-termination to allow for this retrieval, after which it will be permanently deleted.

### 5.3 Our Rights
You grant Nooryx a worldwide, non-exclusive license to host, copy, and transmit your data as required for us to provide the Service. Additionally, you agree that we may aggregate and anonymize metadata (e.g., "Total API requests," "Average SKU count") to improve system performance and for benchmarking purposes, provided no Customer Confidential Information is disclosed.

{/* ## 6. Third-Party Integrations

Nooryx integrates with third-party services (including but not limited to Shopify, Slack, and shipping carriers) to provide a seamless operational flow.

### 6.1 Interoperability
You acknowledge that the Service acts as a connector between your inventory and these third parties. Nooryx is not responsible for:
- Downtime or API failures on the part of the third-party provider.
- Data corruption caused by third-party webhooks sending incorrect information to Nooryx.
- Changes to third-party Terms of Service that render an integration obsolete.

If a third-party service (e.g., Shopify) modifies their API in a way that breaks the Nooryx integration, we will make reasonable commercial efforts to fix it, but we do not guarantee immediate continuity.

## 7. Cancellation and Termination

### 7.1 Cancellation by You
You are solely responsible for properly canceling your account. You can cancel your account at any time via the "Account & Security" panel. An email or phone request to cancel your account is not considered cancellation.

### 7.2 Termination by Us
We may suspend or terminate your access to the Service if you materially breach these Terms, violate applicable law, or use the Service in a manner that poses legal, security, or operational risk to Nooryx or other customers. Where feasible, we will provide notice and an opportunity to cure prior to termination.

## 8. Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law, Nooryx and its suppliers shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages, including but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data, or other intangible losses resulting from:

1. The use or the inability to use the Service;
2. The cost of procurement of substitute goods and services;
3. Unauthorized access to or alteration of your transmissions or data;
4. Statements or conduct of any third party on the Service;
5. Calculations regarding inventory value, or COGS.

In no event shall Nooryx’s total liability to you for all damages, losses, or causes of action exceed the amount you have paid Nooryx in the last twelve (12) months, or one hundred dollars ($100), whichever is greater.

2. **Modifications:** We reserve the right to update and change the Terms of Service from time to time without notice. Continued use of the Service after any such changes shall constitute your consent to such changes.
3. **Governing Law:** These Terms shall be governed by the laws of the jurisdiction in which the Provider is domiciled, without regard to principles of conflicts of law.
4. **Severability:** If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be struck and the remaining provisions shall be enforced.
