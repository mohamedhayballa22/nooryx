The foundational principle of Nooryx is that inventory management is a branch of **transactional accounting**. Your physical stock is a highly liquid financial asset, and it must be managed with the same rigor you apply to your bank account.

This belief drives our entire architecture, which is built on two inseparable components: **The Ledger** (the source of truth) and **The State** (the current reality).
This relationship between history and the current reality becomes much clearer when you visualize it. The interactive illustration below shows how sequential ledger entries mathematically produce the current state.

## The Ledger

The Ledger is the heart of Nooryx. It is a permanent, sequential record of every stock-related action that has ever occurred in your organization.

### Why a Ledger?

Traditional inventory systems often rely on **overwrite operations**: when you receive 10 units and then ship 2, the old "On Hand" number (10) is simply replaced with the new one (8). This approach is fast but fragile and unauditable. If the number is wrong, you have no way to trace *why*, *when*, or *who* made the mistake.

Nooryx operates differently. A Ledger entry is created for every event. Once recorded, a Ledger entry **can never be deleted or modified**. If a mistake is made (e.g., you logged the wrong quantity), you don't edit the original entry; you create a new, corrective entry (a reversal or adjustment) that explicitly documents the correction.

## The State

The State is your real-time, current inventory position. This architecture delivers two powerful advantages:

### 1. Perfect Auditability

Because The State is derived from The Ledger, every single number in your inventory is mathematically traceable back to its origin.

* **Question:** Why does SKU-A have 50 units?
* **Answer:** By reviewing the Ledger, you can see the precise sequence of receipts, transfers, and shipments that resulted in that final quantity. This level of detail is indispensable for financial audits, reconciliation, and troubleshooting discrepancies.

### 2. Time-Travel Inventory

Since The Ledger is a historical record, Nooryx can calculate **The State** at any arbitrary point in the past.

Need to know exactly how much stock you had at the close of business on the last day of Q2? Simply run the calculation against all Ledger entries up to that date and time. This functionality is essential for accurate month-end closing, historical reporting, and cost-of-goods-sold (COGS) calculations.
