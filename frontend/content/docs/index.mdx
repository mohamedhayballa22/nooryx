**Nooryx is a high-definition inventory management platform designed for teams who demand precision, speed, and clarity.**

We built Nooryx because traditional inventory software forces growing brands to compromise. You are often stuck choosing between the fragility of spreadsheets or the rigidity of bloated, legacy ERPs. The standard for inventory software has been too low for too long.

Nooryx eliminates that trade-off. We provide an architectural solution that delivers the swift, intuitive user experience of a modern application alongside the rigorous, transparent audit trails demanded by high-stakes operations.

<Callout type="info" title="The Core Philosophy">
  Nooryx treats inventory as a vital business asset rather than a static number. We utilize an **immutable, transactional ledger** to record every movement. This approach guarantees that your stock levels are always traceable and auditable. Read our <Link href="/docs/philosophy">**Core Philosophy**</Link> to understand the architecture behind this precision.
</Callout>

## What makes Nooryx different?

We focus on the specific, complex problems of inventory state management. We don't try to be your CRM, your website builder, or your payroll provider. We are the source of truth for your stock.

    We never just overwrite numbers. Every change in stock is a recorded event. You can trace the entire history of a single SKU from receipt to shipment with zero gaps in the data.

    Nooryx distinguishes between **On Hand** (physical) and **Available** (sellable) stock, holding items for orders before they leave the door to avoid overselling.

    Understand your true holding costs. Choose from **FIFO**, **LIFO**, and **WAC** (Weighted Average Cost) to view your inventory value through the lens that fits your strategy.

## What Nooryx is (and isn't)

To get the most out of Nooryx, it helps to understand exactly where we fit in your infrastructure.

### Nooryx is...
* **An Operational Inventory Engine:** A system purpose-built to manage the true lifecycle of your stock.
* **Deterministic:** Inputs produce predictable outputs. We rely on logic, not magic numbers.
* **Collaborative:** Designed for teams, enabling real-time, concurrent access to your inventory data.
* **Blazingly Fast:** Engineered for sub-second interactions.

### Nooryx is not...
* **A Website Builder:** We integrate deeply with your different channels rather than trying to replace them.
* **A General Purpose ERP:** We don't manage HR or Payroll. We are dedicated to perfecting Inventory.
* **A Spreadsheet:** Spreadsheets allow for hidden errors and broken formulas. Nooryx imposes the necessary structure to ensure data integrity at scale.
